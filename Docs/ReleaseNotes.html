    <h1>AtlasWerks Project</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      AtlasWerks is a set of high-performance tools for diffeomorphic
      3D image registration and atlas building.  Applications support
      atlas building on GPUs, clusters, and clusters of GPUs.  While
      in theory the project is cross-platform, at this point we only
      test and support linux.
    </p>

    <h2>Executables</h2> 
    <p>
      The four primary executables follow a simple naming convention
      and generate either atlases or individual warps using either the
      greedy or full LDMM equations:
    </p>
    <table border="1">
      <tr><td></td><td>LDMM</td><td>Greedy</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Atlas Generation</td><td>LDMMAtlas</td><td>GreedyAtlas</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Individual Warp</td><td>LDMMWarp</td><td>GreedyWarp</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      All four executables 
    </p>
    <h2>Setup Script</h2>
    <p>
      There is a somewhat experimental setup script which will attempt
      to download and compile the dependencies and code available in
      the source distribution, called BuildAtlasWerks.sh
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      Although in theory the AtlasWerks library is cross-platform,
      right now it is only being tested and used on linux systems, so
      this is all that is actively supported.  However, if you are
      interested in working with us to add support for your favorite
      platform (and possibly willing to run a nightly build on your
      machine), let us know.
    </p>

    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few external dependencies you will need to download
      and install in order to compile the AtlasWerks library.  ITK and
      VTK use the CMake build system.  If you are unfamiliar with
      CMake, you can either read the install documentation of these
      packages, visit <a href="http://www.cmake.org">cmake.org</a>, or
      look at the brief description about compiling
      AtlasWerks <a href="#building">below</a>.  Compiling ITK and VTK
      is a very similar process.
      <dl>
	<dt><a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  Latest version is supported as of last check.  Version 3.10
	  has also been tested, but earlier (perhaps much earlier)
	  versions are believed to be compatible.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.vtk.org">VTK</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  Latest version as of last check (5.4.2) is supported.
	  Versions 5.0.4 and 5.2.1 have been tested as well, and
	  earlier versions should work here too.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.fltk.org">FLTK</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  Currently only the 1.1.* branch is supported (1.3.* and 2.*
	  do not work).  Version 1.1.7 has been tested.
	</dd>
	<dt>LAPACK and BLAS</dt>
	<dd>
	  LAPACK Version 3.1.1 has been tested, but any version should
	  work.  Get the libraries through your operating system's
	  software management system.
	</dd>
	<dt>FFTW3</dt>
	<dd>
	  Version 3.1.* has been tested, but others should work as
	  well.  Get the development libraries (fftw3-devel and
	  fftw3-threads-devel) through your operating system's
	  software management system.
	</dd>
      </dl>
      <h3>Optional Dependencies</h3>

      <dl>
	<dt><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html">CUDA</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  To compile GPU code, CUDA 3.1 or 3.2 is required, as well as
	  the CUDA SDK and a compatible NVidia card.  Testing has only
	  been performed on NVidia Tesla cards and newer Fermi cards.
	  To compile with GPU support, set the USE_CUDA CMake flag to
	  True.  See the section in Building for build instructions
	  for CUDA.
	</dd>
	<dt><a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">MPI</a></dt>
	<dd>
	  To support cluster processing, an MPI implementation must be
	  avaiable.  We currently
	  use <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/">OpenMPI</a> 1.4.1.
	</dd>

    <h2><a name="cmake">Building</a></h2>
    <p>
      The AtlasWerks project is built
      using <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> version 2.6,
      although there have been reports of success using v. 2.4.  CMake
      generates standard build files for your platform, Makefiles on
      linux and Visual Studio projects on Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have already installed and built the dependencies (which
      you should have already done), then you should be somewhat
      familiar with building a project using CMake.  However, we'll go
      over the basic procedure here:
      <ol>
	<li>Create a directory where the project will be built</li>
	<li>Run ccmake to configure the project and generate the
	makefiles</li>
	<li>Run make to build the project</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      For instance, if your top-level AtlasWerks directory (the
      highest-level directory containing a <kbd>CMakeLists.txt</kbd>
      file) is located at <kbd>..../AtlasWerks</kbd>, first create a
      directory to build the project in.  You can do this anywhere,
      but assume we put it inside the AtlasWerks directory and call it
      'build'.  Now cd into the <kbd>..../AtlasWerks/build</kbd>
      directory and run <kbd>ccmake ..</kbd>, since the first time you
      run ccmake for this project you need to give it the path to the
      directory containing the top-level CMakeLists.txt file.  To
      configure a CMake project with the default options, the general
      procedure is to press the 'c' key (for 'configure') until no new
      options are shown in the interface (new options are denoted by a
      '*').  After no new options are shown, the build files can be
      generated by pressing 'g'.  This will exit CMake, and you can
      build the project by running <kbd>make</kbd>.
    </p>
    <h3> Building with CUDA </h3>
    <p>
      If you have CUDA installed and want to compile cuda-enabled
      code, first set the <kbd>USE_CUDA</kbd> CMake flag to True.  You
      will most likely have to provide the path to the CUDA SDK on
      your machine as well.  To do this with CUDA SDK v. 3.1/3.2, set
      the <kbd>CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR</kbd> to the location of
      the <kbd>C</kbd> directory in the SDK, for
      example <kbd>/home/myhome/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/C</kbd>. Unfortunately
      CMake often fails to find the 'cutil' and 'cudpp' libraries,
      which must be specified manually via the <kbd>CUDPP_LIB</kbd>
      and <kbd>CUDA_CUT_LIBRARY</kbd> CMake variables.  These are, for
      example, at
      <br/><kbd>/home/myhome/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/C/lib/libcutil_x86_64.a</kbd>
      <br/> and
      <br/><kbd>/home/myhome/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK/C/common/lib/linux/libcudpp_x86_64.a</kbd>
      <br/> respecively.
    </p>

    <h3> Building with MPI support </h3>
    <p>
      To enable MPI support, set the <kbd>USE_MPI</kbd> CMake flag to
      True, and specify the location of <kbd>MPI_COMPILER</kbd>.
      CMake should be able to figure out the rest.
    </p>

    <h3> Possible Problems </h3>
    <p>
      If CMake does not automatically find your ITK or VTK directories, enter the
      path to the <kbd>build</kbd> directory of your ITK or VTK installation.
